* Title:  Art Styling project
* Author: Minh Nguyen
* Date:   April 23, 2021
*
* Description
*      In this project, we will learn how to use deep learning to create new image in the style
* 	of another image with original input image. This is done by defining a loss function which
*	tries to minimise the difference between content image, style imgage and generated imgage
*
* How to get the code running:
* 
* This application uses Python 3.7
* Install the following packages prior to running
*   1) Numpy version 1.19.2
*   2) Keras version 2.3.1
*   3) Scikit-learn version 0.24.1
*   4) Tensorflow version 1.15
*
*   
*   
* The program runs in Python Notebook enviroment
*	In Notebook, it should run one by one as each comment in the main code ( # Imports libraries, # Hyperparams,...)
